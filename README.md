Rust bindings to the [MapLibre Native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native) map rendering engine.

## Usage

In order to compile, you must have the following dependencies (linux). No other system has been tested yet (PRs welcome). See the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for the full list of dependencies.

* `ccache`
* `CMake` + `Ninja`

### Apt Packages
* `build-esential`
* `libcurl4-openssl-dev`
* `libuv1-dev`
* `libjpeg-dev`
* `libpng-dev`
* `libglfw3-dev`
* `libwebp-dev`
* `libopengl0`
* `mesa-vulkan-drivers`

## Development

* This project is easier to develop with [just](https://github.com/casey/just#readme), a modern alternative to `make`.
  Install it with `cargo install just`.
* To get a list of available commands, run `just`.
* To run tests, use `just test`.

### Compiling MapLibre Native

This crate relies on the MapLibre Native library, which is compiled as part of the build process. There are several ways to compile the library:
* if the `MLN_FROM_SOURCE` environment variable is set, the build script will compile the native library from that dir.
* if this repo has been cloned, it will contain the `/maplibre-native` submodule, which will be used to compile the library. Make sure to run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to fetch the submodule.
* if there is no `/maplibre-native` submodule, the build script assumes it is being ran as a dependency, and will try to download the source into the `OUT_DIR`.  Note that this might be slow.
