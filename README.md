Rust bindings to the [MapLibre Native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native) map rendering engine.

## Usage

We use `maplibre-native`s' core build, a static, pre-compiled library.
We also allow you to compile this yourself. Instructions for this are below.

### Apt Packages

> [!NOTE]
> The version of `libicu` is quite specific.
> There [is some work ongoing upstream](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/issues/3483) to build this into the static library we pull.

```shell
sudo apt-get install -y \
  build-essential \
  libcurl4-openssl-dev \
  libglfw3-dev \
  libjpeg-dev \
  libpng-dev \
  libsqlite3-dev \
  libuv1-dev \
  libwebp-dev \
  libz-dev \
  libicu-dev

# OpenGL
sudo apt-get install -y libopengl0 libx11-dev

# Vulkan
sudo apt-get install -y mesa-vulkan-drivers glslang-dev
```

## Development

* This project is easier to develop with [just](https://github.com/casey/just#readme), a modern alternative to `make`.
  Install it with `cargo install just`.
* To get a list of available commands, run `just`.
* To run tests, use `just test`.

### Compiling MapLibre Native

This crate relies on the MapLibre Native library, which is compiled as part of the build process:
* if the `MLN_FROM_SOURCE` environment variable is set, the build script will compile the native library from that dir.
* if this repo has been cloned, it will contain the `/maplibre-native` submodule, which will be used to compile the library. Make sure to run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to fetch the submodule.
* if there is no `/maplibre-native` submodule, the build script assumes it is being run as a dependency, and will try to download the source into the `OUT_DIR`.  Note that the first might take significant time to download and compile.

### MapLibre Native Dependency Management

The specific version of [MapLibre Native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native) used is controlled by the `MLN_REVISION` constant in `build.rs`.
This dependency is automatically updated via a GitHub workflow on the 1st of each month repository.
A pull request is created if an update is available.
